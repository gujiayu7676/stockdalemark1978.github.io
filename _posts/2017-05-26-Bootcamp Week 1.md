# Bootcamp Thoughts at the End of Week 1

## What I've Learned This Week...

First and foremost, coding/programming is not easy. There are so many small things I was completely unaware of which take place just to get everything setup to start coding. Learning how to navigate via the terminal and using git have been a challenge.

Working with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, while challenging, have been fun. It's awesome to know that I can make something and see the results in a matter of minutes(or hours in most cases for me :-)).

## Why I Joined the Bootcamp...

I joined the Bootcamp because I was/am ready for a new chapter. I've worked in healthcare for 13 years. I love working with people and helping, but I am just ready for something new.

## Explanation of Something I Learned...

Something cool that I learned this week was how to structure the layout of a site using the Bootstrap grid system. Sometimes formatting a layout using only HTML and CSS can be challenging (at least for me).

The Bootstrap grid system breaks a page down into a column system. The total width of the columns must add up to 12. From there, you can break down the columns how ever you want to.

For example, you can have three columns, each width of 4. Another example would be to have two columns of 6. In either case, Bootstrap will automatically make sure these columns align properly to show the content in a logial format.
